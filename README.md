# Elevens 8

Follow the instructions provided for Activity 8 in the student lab guide. This is more of an exploratory lab, so you will not need to copy any of your previous code into the repo. Answer the questions from the Student Guide in this document and ensure that you save and push the repo. You have one week to complete this lab.

1. Discuss the similarities and differences between *Elevens*, *Thirteens*, and *Tens*.

    * Answer: In elevens, the kings have a number. But, in thirteens, queens and jacks are given numbers and the king is not. In all games, cards need to be dealt and replaced. In all games, the main point is matching with another card. Each game has very similar programming except that different cards are given values depending on which game it is. 

2. As discussed previously, all of the instance variables are declared in the `Board` class. But it is the `ElevensBoard` class that “knows” the board size, and the ranks, suits, and point values of the cards in the deck. How do the `Board` instance variables get initialized with the `ElevensBoard` values? What is the exact mechanism?

    * Answer: It is through an abstract method.

3. Now examine the files `Board.java` and `ElevensBoard.java`, found in this repository. Identify the `abstract` methods in `Board.java`. See how these methods are implemented in `ElevensBoard`. Do they cover all the differences between *Elevens*, *Thirteens*, and *Tens* as discussed in question 1? Why or why not?

    * Answer:
